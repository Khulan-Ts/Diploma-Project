            daily life, education, and business communication. Students of all ages and nationalities 
            can participate in our communicative program and learn all language skills â€“ speaking, reading,
             writing, and listening. Our teachers are highly skilled and trained to use activities and speaking 
             structures to help students engage with the language and practice with their classmates. We believe 
             in active classrooms where students have the opportunity to engage in the language they are learning, 
             and in combining all language skills together to increase learning and retention. We always seek to 
             use the new methods and research in teaching foreign languages, and we keep our teachers up to date 
             with regular training and observations.</FONT>
